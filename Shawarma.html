<h3>Description</h3>
 <p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish featuring thinly sliced, seasoned meat (traditionally cooked on a vertical spit) that is wrapped in a flatbread (like pita or tortilla) with various toppings and sauces. For a home-cooked version, the seasoned meat is usually cooked in a pan or oven.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For the Chicken and Marinade</strong></li>
    <li> 1.5 lbs (about 680g) Boneless, skinless chicken (thighs or breasts), thinly sliced</li>
 <li> ¼ cup Olive oil</li>
 <li> ¼ cup Lemon juice</li>
 <li> 4-5 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
 <li> 1 tsp Ground Cumin</li>
 <li> 1 tsp Ground Coriander</li>
 <li> 1 tsp Sweet Paprika</li>
 <li> ½ tsp Turmeric powder (or Curry powder)</li>
 <li> ½ tsp Ground Cardamom (optional, but adds authentic flavor)</li>
 <li> ¼ tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
 <li> ¼ tsp Cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)</li>
 <li> 1 tsp Salt</li>
 <li> ½ tsp Black pepper</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>For Assembly and Toppings</strong></li>
 <li> 4-6 Pita bread or Tortilla wraps</li>
 <li> Sliced vegetables: Shredded lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, and thinly sliced onions.</li>
  <li>Pickles: Sliced pickled turnips or cucumbers (optional).</li>
 <li>Sauce: Mayonnaise/ketchup blend, Tahini sauce, or a yogurt-garlic sauce (Toum or plain yogurt with garlic/lemon).</li>
  <br>
  </ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Steps to Make It</strong></li>
  <br>
  <li>Prepare the Marinade: In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and all the dry spices (cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, cayenne, salt, and pepper).</li>
 <br>
<li>Marinate the Chicken: Add the thinly sliced chicken to the bowl and toss until every piece is fully coated. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or ideally 2-4 hours, or overnight for maximum flavor.</li>
<br>
 <li> Cook the Chicken: Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken (do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary). Cook for 5-8 minutes, flipping the pieces, until the chicken is browned, cooked through, and has some slightly charred edges, mimicking the spit-roasted flavor.
</li>
<br>
 <li> Slice and Shred: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the heat and slice it into thinner strips or shred it.</li>
<br>
<li>Assemble the Shawarma: Warm the pita bread or tortilla on a dry pan for about 30 seconds per side. Lay the flatbread on a piece of foil or parchment paper.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Layer: Spread a layer of your preferred sauce onto the center of the bread. Layer with the sliced/shredded vegetables, and top with the hot, sliced shawarma chicken. Drizzle with more sauce and add pickles if using.</li>
 <br>
 <li>Wrap and Serve: Tightly fold the sides of the wrap inward, then roll it up from the bottom. Serve immediately.</li>
